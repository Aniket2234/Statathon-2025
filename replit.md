## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Streamlit web application framework
- **Interface Design**: Modern, government-compliant UI with wide layout and sidebar navigation
- **State Management**: Session-based state management using Streamlit's session state
- **File Upload**: Multi-format file upload support (CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, Parquet)

### Backend Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Core Modules**: Modular architecture with separate components for:
  - Data handling and validation
  - Risk assessment and privacy evaluation
  - Privacy enhancement techniques
  - Utility measurement and quality assessment
  - Report generation and visualization
- **Processing**: In-memory data processing with chunked loading for large files
- **Caching**: Streamlit resource caching for performance optimization

## Key Components

### 1. Data Handler (`core/data_handler.py`)
- **Purpose**: Centralized data loading, validation, and format conversion
- **Supported Formats**: CSV, Excel, JSON, XML, Parquet, TSV
- **Features**: Automatic encoding detection, chunked processing, error handling
- **Rationale**: Provides robust data ingestion with support for government data formats

### 2. Risk Assessment Module (`core/risk_assessment.py`)
- **Purpose**: Evaluate re-identification risks using attack simulation scenarios
- **Techniques**: Equivalence class analysis, prosecutor attack simulation, k-anonymity assessment
- **Output**: Comprehensive risk metrics with visualizations
- **Rationale**: Essential for government compliance and privacy risk evaluation

### 3. Privacy Enhancement Module (`core/privacy_enhancement.py`)
- **Purpose**: Apply various anonymization techniques to protect sensitive data
- **Techniques**: 
  - K-anonymity with global/local recoding
  - L-diversity for attribute diversity
  - T-closeness for distribution preservation
  - Differential privacy with noise addition
- **Rationale**: Multiple privacy techniques ensure flexibility for different government use cases

### 4. Utility Measurement Module (`core/utility_measurement.py`)
- **Purpose**: Assess data quality preservation after anonymization
- **Metrics**: Statistical similarity, correlation preservation, distribution analysis
- **Features**: Machine learning utility assessment, visualization of trade-offs
- **Rationale**: Critical for ensuring anonymized data remains useful for analysis

- **Output Formats**: HTML, PDF (with FPDF2), interactive visualizations
- **Templates**: Executive, technical, and comprehensive report templates
- **Rationale**: Government requires detailed documentation and compliance reports

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Files uploaded through Streamlit interface → DataHandler processes and validates
2. **Risk Assessment**: Original data → RiskAssessment module → Risk metrics and visualizations
3. **Privacy Enhancement**: Original data + configuration → PrivacyEnhancement module → Anonymized data
4. **Utility Measurement**: Original + anonymized data → UtilityMeasurement module → Quality metrics
5. **Report Generation**: All results → ReportGenerator → Comprehensive reports and visualizations

- **Configuration**: JSON-based privacy profiles and settings

### Government Environment Considerations
- **Security**: Data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Compliance**: ISO/IEC 27001 practices, NIST Privacy Framework alignment
- **Scalability**: Modular design allows for distributed processing if needed
- **Data Isolation**: Session-based processing ensures data separation between users

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Streamlit Choice**: Selected for rapid development and government-friendly interface, avoiding complex web frameworks
2. **Modular Design**: Separate core modules enable independent testing and maintenance of privacy techniques
3. **In-Memory Processing**: Chosen for security (no persistent data storage) and simplicity, with chunking for large files
4. **JSON Configuration**: Human-readable configuration files for transparency and government audit requirements
5. **Multiple Privacy Techniques**: Comprehensive suite ensures compliance with various government privacy requirements
6. **Utility Preservation Focus**: Balanced approach ensures anonymized data remains analytically useful

The architecture prioritizes government compliance, security, and ease of use while maintaining flexibility for different anonymization requirements across various government departments.
