================================================================================
5. PRIVACY ENHANCEMENT TECHNIQUES
================================================================================

5.1 K-ANONYMITY
---------------
K-anonymity ensures that each individual in a dataset is indistinguishable
from at least k-1 other individuals with respect to quasi-identifiers.

Theory:
K-anonymity protects against identity disclosure by ensuring that any
combination of quasi-identifier values appears for at least k individuals.
This makes it impossible to uniquely identify any individual based solely
on quasi-identifiers.

Implementation:
- Generalization: Replace specific values with more general ones
- Suppression: Remove records or values that violate k-anonymity
- Clustering: Group similar records and generalize within clusters

Parameters:
- k-value: Higher values provide more privacy but may reduce utility
- Generalization hierarchy: Defines how values are generalized
- Suppression limit: Maximum percentage of data that can be suppressed

Best Practices:
- Choose k-value based on dataset size and sensitivity
- Minimize suppression to preserve data utility
- Use domain knowledge for generalization hierarchies
- Consider computational complexity for large datasets

5.2 L-DIVERSITY
---------------
L-diversity extends k-anonymity by ensuring that sensitive attributes within
each equivalence class have at least l diverse values.

Theory:
K-anonymity alone may not prevent attribute disclosure if sensitive attributes
lack diversity within equivalence classes. L-diversity addresses this by
requiring each equivalence class to have diverse sensitive attribute values.

Types:
- Distinct l-diversity: At least l distinct sensitive values
- Entropy l-diversity: Entropy of sensitive values ≥ log(l)
- Recursive (c,l)-diversity: Most frequent value appears ≤ c times

Implementation:
- Apply k-anonymity first to create equivalence classes
- Check l-diversity constraint for each class
- Further generalize or suppress violating classes
- Balance privacy and utility through parameter tuning

Parameters:
- l-value: Number of diverse values required
- Sensitive attribute: Attribute requiring diversity protection
- Diversity measure: Type of l-diversity to apply

Considerations:
- May require significant data modification
- Effectiveness depends on sensitive attribute distribution
- Computational complexity increases with dataset size

5.3 T-CLOSENESS
---------------
T-closeness requires that the distribution of sensitive attributes in each
equivalence class is close to the distribution in the overall dataset.

Theory:
Even with l-diversity, an equivalence class may have a skewed distribution
of sensitive attributes that differs from the global distribution. T-closeness
addresses this by ensuring distributions are similar within threshold t.

Distance Measures:
- Earth Mover's Distance (EMD): Optimal transport cost between distributions
- Hierarchical distance: Based on taxonomy of sensitive values
- Variational distance: Maximum difference between probability masses

Implementation:
- Calculate global distribution of sensitive attributes
- For each equivalence class, calculate local distribution
- Measure distance between local and global distributions
- Generalize classes that exceed t-closeness threshold

Parameters:
- t-value: Maximum allowed distance (0 < t ≤ 1)
- Distance measure: Method for comparing distributions
- Sensitive attribute: Attribute requiring distribution protection

Trade-offs:
- Stronger privacy protection than l-diversity
- May significantly impact data utility
- Computational complexity for distance calculations

5.4 DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY
------------------------
Differential privacy provides mathematical guarantees that the output of a
data analysis algorithm is insensitive to the presence or absence of any
single individual.

Theory:
A randomized algorithm M satisfies ε-differential privacy if for all datasets
D1 and D2 differing by at most one element, and for all possible outputs S:
P[M(D1) ∈ S] ≤ exp(ε) × P[M(D2) ∈ S]

Mechanisms:
- Laplace mechanism: Adds Laplace noise to numerical outputs
- Gaussian mechanism: Adds Gaussian noise with composition guarantees
- Exponential mechanism: For non-numerical outputs

Implementation:
- Determine global sensitivity of the query function
- Calculate required noise magnitude based on ε and sensitivity
- Add calibrated noise to query results
- Ensure privacy budget is properly managed

Parameters:
- ε (epsilon): Privacy parameter (smaller = more private)
- δ (delta): Failure probability (for approximate DP)
- Sensitivity: Maximum change in output from single record

Privacy Budget:
- Each query consumes privacy budget
- Sequential composition: εtotal = Σεi
- Parallel composition: εtotal = max(εi)
- Advanced composition: Tighter bounds for many queries

5.5 SYNTHETIC DATA GENERATION
-----------------------------
Synthetic data generation creates artificial datasets that maintain statistical
properties of the original data without exposing individual records.

Approaches:

STATISTICAL METHODS:
- Marginal distribution sampling
- Correlation structure preservation
- Copula-based generation

MACHINE LEARNING METHODS:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Autoregressive models

HYBRID APPROACHES:
- Statistical preprocessing with ML refinement
- Ensemble methods combining multiple approaches
- Domain-specific customizations

Implementation Considerations:
- Evaluation metrics for synthetic data quality
- Privacy guarantees and utility preservation
- Computational requirements and scalability
- Domain-specific constraints and requirements

Quality Metrics:
- Statistical similarity to original data
- Correlation preservation accuracy
- Distribution matching fidelity
- Machine learning utility preservation
