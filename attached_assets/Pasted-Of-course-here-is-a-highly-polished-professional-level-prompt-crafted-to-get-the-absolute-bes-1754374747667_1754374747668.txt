Of course â€” here is a **highly polished, professional-level prompt** crafted to get the absolute best UI/UX transformation for your Streamlit app:

**ðŸ§© Prompt:**

> I have a working Streamlit web app, but I want it completely redesigned to look and feel like a modern, professional desktop application or premium SaaS dashboard. Transform the user interface into a visually stunning, responsive, and intuitive experience that follows cutting-edge UI/UX principles.
>
> Implement a fully structured layout with:
>
> * A collapsible **sidebar navigation** with icons and active state styling
> * An optional **top navbar** for user profile, notifications, and global actions
> * A **main content area** with smooth grid-based layout using `st.columns()` and `st.container()`
>
> Design the dashboard with:
>
> * Interactive **stat cards** featuring icons, gradients, shadows, and hover effects
> * **Dynamic charts** using Plotly, Altair, or ECharts with tooltips and responsive resizing
> * Custom **widgets and buttons** styled with HTML/CSS to match modern app interfaces
> * Light and dark theme compatibility, with consistent color palette, spacing, and typography
>
> Enhance the user experience with:
>
> * Custom fonts (via Google Fonts or inline CSS)
> * Icons from Font Awesome or similar libraries
> * Smooth transitions, hover animations, and subtle effects
>
> Use the best Streamlit tools and libraries including:
>
> * `streamlit-option-menu` for the sidebar
> * `plotly`, `altair`, or `echarts` for data visualization
> * `streamlit-extras` for badges, buttons, tooltips, and layout enhancements
> * Custom CSS via `st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True)` for pixel-perfect design
>
> Avoid the default Streamlit appearance entirely â€” the result should resemble a fully polished software product UI similar to dashboards like Notion, Linear, Superhuman, or modern admin templates like AdminLTE or Material UI.
